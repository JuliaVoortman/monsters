# Technical Project Showcase - Julia Voortman - Contentful Support Engineer Interview

This is a short README about this React app, and my previous technical experience! 

## 1. Monsters, a (tiny) React app connecting to Contentful

I didn't get as far along with this as I'd hoped, but this is a small React app that takes data from my Contentful space. 

In Contentful, I defined two content types:

- Page (title, image)
- Monster (name, image, description, top skill, strength)

I also created 2 page entries:

- Home
- Monsters

And 3 monster entries:

- Bumblethump
- Frightwhisker
- Grizzlepuff

I started to add some routing and separate components for the Home and Monster pages, but ran into a few problems I didn't know how to solve (yet)!

With a bit more time, I would have liked the app to have:

1. A link on the Home page to the Monsters page. 
2. A Monsters page, a list of names and images for each monster, linked to their respective monster details page.
2. A page for individual monsters.

## 2. My previous technical experience

I started out in the software world as a tinkerer because I liked playing web games. At 10, I got my first taste of HTML and CSS and designed myself a custom homepage for an online game called Horseland. 

### The Ultimate Horse - Game

In my early teens, I partnered with a friend who had some programming skills and together we built an online game called The Ultimate Horse, which was a browser based horse adoption and racing game.

While running this game and later others I picked up a few skills, such as:

- Buying domain names, setting up SSL certificates and DNS configurations
- Making small updates to HTML embedded in PHP scripts
- Uploading assets and organising file folders
- Updating MySQL database field values
- Dealing with our hosting company to make sure we had appropriate server resources 
- How to manage bug complaints and feature requests from a userbase of several thousand

### Other Games - Tygras.com and Wulves.com

Later on, I hired other freelancers and together we created two new games, launched in 2008 and 2011. These games were built with PHP, JavaScript and mySQL.

Neither game is still online unfortunately, but I can show some of our graphics and UI in an [old article](https://softwarehamilton.com/2014/09/27/interview-with-wulves-team-leader-julia-voortman/):

### Professional Experience

My first professional job was as a Web Developer/Graphic Designer. At this job I learned a few more skills, such as:

- How to read code a little better (took a course on Ruby/Rails, and later JavaScript/React)
- How to customize Wordpress files and plugins
- How to set up and run apps locally 
- How to use Git/Github

In more recent years, I've been:

- Gaining a better understanding of how APIs work
- Learning how CD/CI works
- Learning lots about web crawlers and successfully testing websites as a bot
- Learning lots about web accessibility

And yesterday, I:

- Learned about the difference between an REST API and a GraphQL API!
- Got to grips with content modelling and best practices.

I love learning, and hope to continue doing so at Contentful!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
